# DAVIM

A place for me to store all of the VIM motions & commands that I've been learning. I also took this as an opportunity to use Svelte!

## Things I would love to add

- Responsive mode, it'd be great to be able to view this on mobile or tablet.
- Theme changing, at the moment it is mainly Dracula, but it'd be cool to change that.
- Tags display, the data here is tagged, but there is currently no visual indication of them.
- Preview commands in code, it'd be cool to see a demonstration of what the code does.
